## Why does our app need access to some features of your device?

All popular apps need access to some of a smartphone&#39;s features in order to fulfill their functionality and provide a relevant user experience.

It&#39;s standard for iOS devices to notify the user when an app asks to do something that might be especially important. These notifications let the user know how an app operates behind the scenes — is it using the microphone, the camera, the location? You can always grant or refuse an app&#39;s permission to access those features.

Our app only requires that users provide a valid phone number user the apps. It does also need personal information like name and email that are optional. It only asks to use features of your smartphone that will bring you a more enjoyable experience and maximize the quality of our service.

The table below explains the different kinds of iOS permissions our app might ask for. You&#39;ll notice we don&#39;t ask for access to your calendar or microphone — only to things that will make it easier for you to use the app. If you don&#39;t want to grant a certain permission (or any permission at all), you can simply refuse. The app will still operate and you can use some services but not all normally.

# Camera

# Location

# Mobile Data

# 1. Camera


Why it&#39;s necessary

If you want to generate or scan a Qrcode, we give you the option to scan the qcode with your phone&#39;s camera. The app doesn&#39;t store these images. It only decode informations and displays them on your app.

If you don&#39;t want to grant this permission, simply refuse and you will not be able to use the principle power of this app.

How to turn it off

You can disable the app&#39;s camera access in your device settings:

> Settings → Okohi → Camera

> Settings → Privacy → Camera → Okohi

# 2. Location

Why it&#39;s necessary

The app automatically determines your current location to find a proper pickup point for your agency you want to register. This information can come from GPS, known Wi-Fi networks, or both.

If you deny location permission, you can manually enter your agency address name only.

 How to turn it off

You can disable location services for the app in your device settings:

> Settings → Okohi → Location

> Settings → Privacy → Location services → Okohi

# 3. Mobile Data

Why it&#39;s necessary

The app needs access to mobile internet data to operate in some case. If you opt out of this, you can still use this app via Wi-Fi or stay offline.

How to turn it off

You can disable the app&#39;s access to mobile data in your device settings:

> Settings → Okohi → Mobile Data

> Settings → Mobile Data → Okohi

The application is subject to change and we warn you and will update this page so that you have a good understanding of the use of the services requested.
